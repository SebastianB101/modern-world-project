        <div id="text-box-2-1" class="text-boxes-left-2">
          <img class="img" src="mona.jpeg">
          <p class="p-2">The Mona Lisa is undeniably a staple of all Renaissance art, as it is the most widely recognized and renowned piece of art in the world. The painting is secularist due to it firstly and most importantly, not showing any resemblance of religion, but also because of what it represented. It illustrates the economic disparity between the people back in this time, where only the wealthy could afford paintings, or to be painted.</p>

        <div id="text-box-2-2" class="text-boxes-left-2">
          <img class="img" src="vman.jpeg">
          <p class="p-2">The drawing depicts a man in a T-position and an A-position. He is placed inside a nearly perfect circle and square. The drawing represents Da Vinci’s concept of the ideal human body. The drawing represents Humanism as it’s a drawing of the naked body and a clear study on human anatomy. It also represents Classism as the drawing was inspired by the Roman architect Vitruvius, the circle and square are directly taken from the Book III of his treatise De architectura.</p>

        <div id="text-box-2-3" class="text-boxes-right-2">
          <img class="img" src="parachute.jpeg">
          <p class="p-2">The base was made of wood and the canvas was made of “coated cloth”. It weighed a hefty 185 pounds, on June 26, 2000, British balloonist Adrian Nicholas proved da Vinci’s invention worked. It represents Secularism because of the lack of religious content and influence. It represents humanism by the fact it was designed by Da Vinci himself, and his individuality influenced others to make their own designs of the parachute and other inventions.          </p>

        <div id="text-box-2-4" class="text-boxes-right-2">
          <img class="img" src="crossbow.jpg">
          <p class="p-2">Leonardo’s Crossbow is a gargantuan shooting weapon designed by Da Vinci. While never physically built, the drawing shows how far advanced he was with his design and engineering. The creation of this design is linked to the Italian prince Ludovico Sforza, who wanted to expand and upgrade his military with requests of designs and weapons, Da Vinci wrote him a letter containing many ideas including the Crossbow. It represents Humanism as it’s an idea that was made before Da Vinci’s time, he added his own unique spin and advancements to it. It also represents Secularism due to the lack of religious intent in the creation and functionality of it.</p>
